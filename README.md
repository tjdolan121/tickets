# Tickets
## This web app was designed to streamline ticket requests from customers for IT support.
### It was my first starter project, and it is based off of Vitor Freita's incredibly comprehensive "A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django".
### This tutorial introduced me to Django, and can be found [here](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com).
### As always, contributions are welcome in any way!  If you have any issues with the repository, please let me know!
